    <h2>Our Services</h2>

    <h3>ðŸ¦· Teeth Cleaning</h3>
    <img src="img/scaling3.jpeg" alt="Teeth Cleaning">
    <p>The step-by-step process ensures that your teeth and gums remain healthy and free from plaque, tartar, and harmful bacteria. By scheduling regular professional cleanings, you can prevent a wide range of dental issues and maintain a bright, confident smile for years to come.</p>

    <h3>Braces & Alignment</h3>
    <img src="img/braces1.jpeg" alt="Braces & Alignment">
    <p>ðŸ”¹ Crooked or Misaligned Teeth â€“ When teeth are not straight and make the smile look uneven. â€“ Braces and aligners slowly move teeth into the correct position.
    <br>ðŸ”¹ Bite Problems (Overbite, Underbite, Crossbite) â€“ Overbite: upper teeth cover the lower teeth too much. â€“ Underbite: lower teeth stick out more than upper teeth. â€“ These affect chewing, speaking, and face shape.
    <br>ðŸ”¹ Gaps Between Teeth â€“ Spaces between teeth can affect appearance and chewing. â€“ Braces/aligners close the gaps and create a proper smile.</p>

    <h3>Teeth Whitening</h3>
    <img src="img/wwer.jpeg" alt="Teeth Whitening">
    <p>Maintaining good oral health is crucial for overall well-being, and teeth whitening can play an important role in achieving that goal. By removing surface stains and brightening your smile, teeth whitening treatments can improve your self-confidence and overall appearance.</p>
    
    <h3>Liser Filling</h3>
    <img src="img/liser filing hhh.jpeg" alt="Liser filling">
    <p>This is done by providing a reading of the by-products produced by tooth decay. Lasers, when used in dental filling procedures, can kill bacteria located in a cavity and this helps in improved long term restorations of the teeth. Anesthetic injections and turbine dental drills are not required when hard tissue dental lasers are used.</p>
    
    <h3>Root canal treatment</h3>
    <img src="img/rct 55.jpeg" alt="rct">
    <p>In fact, most patients report that the pain from the procedure is far less than the pain caused by the tooth infection itself, which can be severe. â€¢ Saves Your Natural Tooth: One of the main benefits of RCT is that it allows you to keep your natural tooth, avoiding the need for extraction.</p>
